Naming is one of the most things in software development (probably, in top 3), but most developers still don't get this.

Currently naming is actually one of the least things to bother about, and since there is always time (and boredom) pressure, it is simply ignored.

  

So why would you care? I already have too many things to do.

  

Problems when not paying attention to naming:

  

- Getting back to a previous project after a while: the ground seems infamiliar, not sure what's going on here, pausing and scrathing own head.

Sound familiar?

  

Trying to understand how things work and why this approach is used?

  

- Imagine how it is for other members of the team: they get to your code and spend significant amount of time trying to understand what is it you tried to do.

  

Why is this so important? Because most of the time developers spend by reading code, not writing it.

And it's ain't a fiction book which is read page by page without getting back to what's already read.

  

With code which is new (or new again) to you, you'd meditate on it. You'd lean back, stare on very same paragraphs over again, go back and forth between

several files -- all of that to build a mental model for a particular functionality.Â 

  

Basically, what you are doing is loading code into own memory, compiling it and trying to run it within your head in order to comprehend its behavior.

Why? Because you have a task to extend that behavior, and in order to find a nice spot for that and also in order not to break anything (unless you'd want to throw in

just whatever sticks, but hopefully it's not you).

  

This might not be that relevant for projects when you work alone, but

  

So, if we imagine that somehow we do smth which reduces other people's time to comprehend the code then it means we save our customer's money,

we save time for ourselves, ...

  

  

  

Why don't people care (that much) about naming?

  

- Code works. Tests pass. I have other things to do.

  

- It doesn't matter, what's the difference?
